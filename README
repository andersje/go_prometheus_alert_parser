builds and runs on golang 1.6 or golang 1.2

build with go build listen_echo.go
run with ./listen_echo

make sure you have stupid_echo as executable.
follow results echoed out to the 'foobar' file.
the stupid_echo script exists ONLY to dump the alert out into your preferred format.  I've provided to files for testing, alert1.json -- a set of firing alerts, and alert-fixed.json.   The second file is a another set of alerts, marked as "recovering".   This should allow you to test out your replacement hookscript.

send data with:

curl -XPOST http://localhost:7890/alerts -d@./alert1.json
and
curl -XPOST http://localhost:7890/alerts -d@./alert-fixed.json

in prometheus alertmanager, configure it thusly:

(under receivers)
  webhook_configs:
  - url: http://serverrunningthislousycode.yourcompany.com:7890/alerts


No protections against someone else sending stuff to this, use iptables if you need that.
